# Outer on Vercel + Neon

PGlite needs a persistent local filesystem, which Vercel's serverless functions don't have. This template swaps it for [Neon](https://neon.tech) — real Postgres, reached over HTTP via [`kysely-neon`](https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely-neon) so there's no TCP connection pooling to manage across invocations — plugged in through Outer's `db: { dialect, kind }` escape hatch (see [SPEC.md → Custom dialects](https://github.com/ilhajs/outer/blob/main/SPEC.md#custom-dialects)).

Because Neon is real Postgres, `kind: "postgres"` is the exact same path the default embedded PGlite dialect uses — no DDL remapping, no different error-code handling, nothing dialect-specific to this template beyond swapping the `Dialect` object itself.

## How it fits together

- **`api/index.ts`** — the whole app in one file: schema, `Outer` instance (`db: { dialect: new NeonDialect({ neon: neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL) }), kind: "postgres" }`), and the Vercel Function itself — `export async function fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response>` that delegates to `outer.handle`.

  **The export must be named `fetch` (or `GET`/`POST`/etc.), not `export default`.** Vercel's Node.js Functions builder — in both `vercel dev` and production — only detects a file as a Web Handler if it has a named export matching an HTTP method or `fetch`; a bare `export default function handler(request: Request)` is _not_ detected as one, and silently falls back to treating the file as a legacy Node.js `(req, res)` handler instead. In that fallback, what your function receives isn't a real Fetch API `Request` at all — `.url` is a bare path, `.headers` is a plain object with no `.get()` — and since nothing in that code path ever calls `res.end()` on the underlying response, every request hangs forever rather than erroring. This is easy to trip over since `(request: Request) => Response` is genuinely valid and documented — it just has to be reachable via a named export, not `default`.

  Deliberately one file, not split across `api/` and `src/`: Vercel's Node.js Functions builder transpiles files individually rather than bundling the module graph, so a relative import to a sibling file can fail to resolve at runtime (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find module '/var/task/src/app'`) even though it typechecks and builds fine locally. Keeping everything in `api/index.ts` sidesteps that entirely — there's nothing for it to fail to resolve. (`scripts/migrate.ts` importing _from_ `api/index.ts` is fine, since `scripts/` is never bundled as a Function in the first place — this constraint only bites Vercel's own bundler, not ordinary local scripts.)

- **`scripts/migrate.ts`** — runs `outer.migrator.migrateToLatest()` once, reusing the exact same `Outer` instance exported from `api/index.ts`.
- **`vercel.json`**'s `buildCommand: "npm run migrate"` runs that script automatically as part of every `vercel deploy` — once per deployment, before the new version goes live. No separate step, no webhook, works on every plan (Hobby included) unlike [Vercel's Account Webhooks](https://vercel.com/docs/webhooks), which need a Pro or Enterprise team. It's also strictly safer than a post-deploy webhook: since migrations run during the _build_, a failed migration fails the build and the previous good deployment stays live — a webhook fired after `deployment.succeeded` would mean broken-schema code is already serving traffic before you find out the migration failed.

  This also directly solves running migrations from inside the Function: a serverless deployment can have many concurrent instances, each with its own cold start, so triggering `migrateToLatest()` from the request path — even memoized per-instance — really means "once per instance," not "once per deployment." `buildCommand` genuinely runs once, before any instance exists.

- **`vercel.json`**'s `rewrites` sends every path to that one function, so `/openapi.json`, `/rpc/**`, etc. all reach it with the original path intact. `outputDirectory: "public"` points at the empty `public/` folder — this project has no static output, and an empty dedicated folder avoids accidentally serving source files as static assets, which pointing it at the project root would risk.

## Getting started

You'll need two stores: a Neon database — either provision one directly at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech), or through [Vercel's Neon integration](https://vercel.com/marketplace/neon) if you want the connection string wired into your Vercel project automatically — and a **private** [Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-blob) store for `.files()` uploads (Storage → Create Database → Blob → access **Private**; see below).

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# paste your Neon connection string into DATABASE_URL in .env
# creating the Blob store sets BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN on the project — `vercel env pull` copies it locally

npm install
npm run migrate   # applies the schema to your Neon database — vercel dev doesn't run buildCommand
npm run dev       # vercel dev — requires `vercel login` first
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/openapi.json](http://localhost:3000/openapi.json) to confirm it's up.

```bash
npm run deploy   # vercel deploy --prod — buildCommand runs `npm run migrate` automatically
```

## File uploads

Same split as the database: Vercel functions have no persistent disk, so the bytes go to [Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-blob). `schema().files({ attachTo: ["post"] })` adds the `file` metadata table and a `post_file` pivot to Neon, and `.files()` on the chain adds `file.upload` / `list` / `get` / `delete` / `attach` / `detach` plus `GET /files/:id`.

`OuterStorage` is three methods (`get` / `set` / `delete`), so Blob's pathname-addressed SDK needs no adapter package — `vercelBlob` in `api/index.ts` is the whole integration:

```ts
storage: vercelBlob; // put/get/del from @vercel/blob, keyed by Outer's storage key
```

Two details worth keeping if you edit it:

- **`access: "private"`.** Bytes reach the browser only through Outer's own `GET /files/:id`, which applies the `.files()` permissions — only the uploader (or an admin) can read a file, and the route returns `404` to everyone else. A public Blob store would hand out a directly-readable URL alongside it, bypassing that check. Switch to a public store only if you also set `permissions: { get: "public" }` on `.files()`.
- **`addRandomSuffix: false`.** Outer's storage keys are already unique and are what it looks the blob up by later; letting Blob rewrite the pathname would strand the bytes.

Uploads travel the normal typed client (`client.file.upload({ file })`) — oRPC switches the request to `multipart/form-data` on its own.

Uploads are buffered in the function's memory, so `maxBytes` (10 MB here) is a real ceiling — and one worth keeping well under Vercel's function memory and request-body limits. For large media, use Blob's [client uploads](https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-blob/client-upload) to send bytes straight to the store instead of through the function.

Set `DATABASE_URL` in your Vercel project's environment variables too (`BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is added for you when the Blob store is created) — `.env` is only read locally by `vercel dev`/`npm run migrate`, and `buildCommand` needs `DATABASE_URL` available at build time (Vercel exposes project env vars to both build and runtime by default, so this should just work once it's set).

## Key/value store

`new Outer({ kv })` surfaces a store as `context.kv`, backed here by Vercel's [Runtime Cache](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtime-cache) through unstorage's `vercel-runtime-cache` driver. It's built into the Vercel runtime — no store to provision, no env vars, no local emulation to run:

```ts
kv: createStorage({ driver: vercelRuntimeCacheDriver({ ttl: 60 }) });
```

Runtime Cache **replaces Vercel KV**, which Vercel is sunsetting. It's a _cache_, not durable storage: entries honor `ttl` (in seconds) but may be evicted early, and the API can't list keys — `getKeys` returns `[]`, so `getKeys`/`clear` won't enumerate. The `post.count` procedure shows the intended shape — read `context.kv` first, recompute and re-cache on a miss — so use it for counters, feature flags, and idempotency keys, not for anything you can't recompute.

## Known rough edges

- `kysely-neon`'s HTTP driver doesn't support interactive transactions (`db.transaction()` throws) or streaming — Kysely's `Migrator` doesn't need either (DDL isn't wrapped transactionally on this dialect), so schema migrations work fine, but don't reach for `db.transaction()` in your own procedures on this path. If you need real transactions, use Neon's `Pool` + Kysely's core `PostgresDialect` over a WebSocket connection instead of `kysely-neon`.
- Function runtime is Node.js, not Edge — chosen deliberately to sidestep Edge's separate set of Node API restrictions for a first pass. Edge would likely work too (the HTTP driver has no Node-specific dependencies) but is unverified here.
